d. What were the processes running at the time?
e. Which 4 processes have the same parent?
f. What commands invoked the above 4 processes?
g. One process is suspicious. Why?
h. Take the process dump of the suspicious process. Save the “strings” output of the process to a .txt file. Did you find any suspicious activity? Discuss?
